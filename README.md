SocialDataMining
================

Repository for the WS2014 course of the University of Osnabrück. Will include little code examples for mining of Twitter data.


Setup for Windows
================

We start by using R. So just install R (http://cran.r-project.org) and RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/)

Data from the StudIp should be placed in the data-directory.
